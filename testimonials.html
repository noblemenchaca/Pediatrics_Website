          <p>
            As parents of four children, my wife and I have always put the medical care of our 
            children as top priority. Relocating to Tucson, AZ from the Boston, MA area meant 
            leaving our wonderful pediatrician, trained at Boston Children's Hospital, behind.
          </p>
          <p>
            For the first three years in Tucson, AZ we had three different pediatric practices, 
            none of which we felt gave our children satisfactory attention and care. On one 
            Saturday we were waiting in the waiting room for 2 and 1/2 hours with our 3 year 
            old who had been up all night suffering from an ear infection. A parent sitting 
            next to us, feeling the same frustration, told us about a new pediatric practice, 
            ISTA Pediatrics.
          </p>
          <p>
            After meeting with Dr. Alpha and discussing concepts and philosophy in the care of 
            our children, we felt strongly that our decision to put our children under his care 
            was a good one. Dr. Alpha has been kind, gentle, caring and fully accessible at all 
            times. Our children know and trust him. He has been spot on in many instances in 
            diagnosing and treating our children on various ailments and injuries. We especially 
            appreciate his home style approach and his caring demeanor. He has enlightened us 
            in many ways of natural and holistic approaches we have implemented successfully 
            in the everyday child care elements of our family. We don't know what we would do 
            without him.
          </p>
          <p>
            Thank you for this opportunity to share our thoughts on the greatness of Dr. Alpha 
            and ISTA Pediatrics.

            Our family appreciates all of your newsletters! They are really wonderful for the 
            parents of your little patients. I just overheard someone talking about your H1N1 
            vaccine newsletter at the girls’ dance class. She was saying how great it was. 
            It's amazing how many parents you've reached out to and given the knowledge to 
            make their own decisions. It's really great!

            I thank you from the bottom of my heart for attending to Alexandra on Tuesday 
            evening. When she woke with that familiar, yet horrifying bark of the croup virus, 
            I felt a tremendous sense of relief knowing that we had you on our team. As you 
            promised, you were a phone call away... and within minutes, you were at our doorstep.

            It’s been a little over four weeks since our baby girl had her first appointment 
            with ISTA Pediatrics. And I am still wowed by the experience my family and I were 
            exposed to. If you haven’t been told lately, I will take the time to tell you now…. 
            you are all marvelous at what you do as physicians!

            It was so wonderful and comforting to have such a fine pediatrician for our 
            first child. We sincerely appreciate your time, patience and warm hospitality 
            during our visits to your office. You always made us feel at ease, and everything 
            you suggested in response to our concerns was very helpful!

            Almost three years ago, just before my daughter was born, I met Dr. Delta for 
            the first time. As a first time mom, I had many questions and concerns (and 
            still do, as she can attest!). From the very beginning she was thoughtful and 
            caring and put my mind at ease about being a new mom.
